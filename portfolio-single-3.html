                          <p>Becoming productive and organized is everyone's need in today's world. Hence people’s develop habits of keeping to-do lists to stay organized, their standards for productivity and their approach to managing and prioritizing tasks. Along with that they can't stick long enough on managining the list everyday as they lack motivation. According to a stanford research, managing daily tasks very much depends on your morning mood. Hence here we come up with a sloution of providing an app which based upon on your mood assigns you minimum number of tasks that the user must complete so that they can maintain themselves on track of productivity.</p>

                    <p>Interview and survey was conducted with the respective stakeholders, usually present at my college, IT offices, HR's and rest who were using or have used various management apps. My research encompassed:<br>
                      <ul><li> Understating the needs of user in a task management app.</li>
                      <li>How it should be structured?</li>
                    <li>How emotions govern their management throughot the day?</li>

                    <p>Understating the target audience was must, so for that picking the specific target user necessary, specifically i wanted to focus upon two types of users the daily user and the one who used to use task management apps but gave up due to any reason.
                      So to achieve this i went on conducting an survey that aimed at finding specific audience with whom i wanted to interact. Along with that i wanted to understand the general opinion of users regarding the task management apps.
                      <br>The purpose to conduct survey was indentify the proper stakeholders.

                    <p>User Interview this is the most important section of research, my aim for these interviews was to gather as much as i could from the end users and to understand the challenges they face or haved while using other similar apps and how they see this app can make a difference in organizing and prioritizing basically enhancing the productivity in theri daily life.<br>So for crisp understanding I divided my Interviews into two categories:<ul><li>Category 1:Current daily Users</li><li>Category 2: Earlier users</li></ul>
                     My inferences after conducting the interviews were:<ul><li>Category 1:<ol><li>Most of them felt that categorization of task was not in their hand. </li><li>They usually don't maintain it on daily basis but they wanted to do so.</li><li>On an average they used to have 5-6 items in their task list</li><li>They could not analyze their performance as most of the apps doesn't keep a track on it.</li><li>Around 90% of them felt that their morning mood governs how they manage their whole day</li><li>One of them wished that the app could have a pre notification, alarm or alert before the task deadline.</li><li>Most of them agreed on the idea of keeping a track on their emotions evey morning and night.</li><li>An analysis section would help them improve upon their productivity.</li><li>Few them were using another app for diary along with a task management app</li></ol></li><li>Category 2:<ol><li>Most of them left the task management apps because they lacked motivation in maintaining the task list everyday</li><li>Some of them found the interface of the apps very confusing and they didn't developed familiarity with it easily.</li><li>Most of them wanted to switch back to task management apps but wanted something that was a lot easier to use.</li><li>Showed interest in having an app that could track their emotions.</li></ol></li></ul></p>
